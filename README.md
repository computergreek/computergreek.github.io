Created using https://twinery.org/.
Big shout out to https://happycoding.io/tutorials/html/hosting and http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/ for teaching me how to use Github to host the .html from Twinery. Domain bought from https://porkbun.com/ because it was cheap, loved that this particular domain registrar was small & indie, and as a bonus they made it REALLY easy to connect the domain to Github Pages with this article from their knowledge base https://kb.porkbun.com/article/64-how-to-connect-your-domain-to-github-pages.
